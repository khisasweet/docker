docker images --digests alpine
### If we want to find an image’s digest before pulling it, we can use the docker buildx imagetools command.

$ docker buildx imagetools inspect nigelpoulton/k8sbook:latest

# You will get a similar output
Name:      docker.io/nigelpoulton/k8sbook:latest
MediaType: application/vnd.docker.distribution.manifest.list.v2+json
Digest:    sha256:13dd59a0c74e9a147800039b1ff4d61201375c008b96a29c5bd17244bce2e14b

#Pulling an image using the digest#
docker pull nigelpoulton/k8sbook@sha256:13dd59a0...bce2e14b

### It’s also possible to directly query the registry API for image data, including digest. The following curl command queries Docker Hub for the digest of the same image.
$ curl https://hub.docker.com/v2/repositories/nigelpoulton/k8sbook/tags/?name=latest | jq '.results[].digest'

### Run the following command to see the different architectures supported behind the alpine:latest tag:
docker buildx imagetools inspect alpine

Summary of the Docker image commands

Let’s revise some of the commands we’ve used.

    docker pull is the command to download images from remote registries. It defaults to Docker Hub but works with other registries. The docker pull alpine:latest command will pull the image tagged as latest from the alpine repository on Docker Hub.

    docker images lists all of the images in our Docker host’s local repository (image cache). We can add the --digests flag to see the SHA256 hashes.

    docker inspect gives us a wealth of image-related metadata in a nicely formatted view.

    docker manifest inspect lets us inspect the manifest list of images stored in registries. The docker manifest inspect ghcr.io/regclient/regctl command will show the manifest list for the regctl image on the GitHub Container Registry (GHCR).

    docker buildx is a Docker CLI plugin that works with Docker’s latest build engine features. We learned how to use the imagetools sub-command to query manifest-related data from images.

    docker scout is a Docker CLI plugin that integrates with the Docker Scout backend to perform image vulnerability scanning. It scans images, provides reports on vulnerabilities, and even suggests remediation actions.

    docker rmi is the command used to delete images. It removes all layer data stored on the local filesystem. However, images associated with containers in running (up) or stopped (exited) states cannot be deleted.


#### Starting a Container

$ docker run -d --name webserver -p 5005:8080 nigelpoulton/ddd-book:web0.1



    The docker run instructs Docker to run a new container.

    The -d flag tells Docker to run it in the background as a daemon process and detach from the local terminal.

    The --name flag tells Docker to name this container webserver.

    The -p 5005:8080 flag maps port 5005 on the local system to port 8080 inside the container. This works because the container’s web server is listening on port 8080.

    The nigelpoulton/ddd-book:web0.1 argument tells Docker which image to use to start the container.

#############################
Once it has a local copy of the image, the daemon makes a request to containerd asking for a new container. containerd then instructs runc to create the container and start the app. It also performs the port mapping.
###########
docker exec -it webserver sh
docker inspect webserver
docker inspect nigelpoulton/ddd-book:web0.1
docker exec webserver cat views/home.pug
docker rm webserver -f

###########

# For your reference, these are the commands you need to run in the terminal.

docker exec -it webserver sh
# Starts an interactive shell session in the running 'webserver' container

vi views/home.pug
# Opens the 'home.pug' file located in the 'views' directory using the 'vi' text editor

docker ps
# Lists all currently running Docker containers

docker stop webserver
# Stops the running 'webserver' container

docker restart webserver
# Restarts the 'webserver' container

docker rm webserver -f
# Forcefully removes the 'webserver' container, even if it’s running

docker ps -a
# Lists all containers, including both running and stopped ones

docker run --name ddd-ctr -it ubuntu:24.04 bash

root@d3c892ad0eb3:/# exit

# Check the status of the exited process
$ docker ps -a

###################################
We can type Ctrl-PQ to exit a container without killing the process we’re attached to. Type Ctrl-PQ to exit the container and run another docker ps command to verify the container is still running this time.

#######################
The always restart policy
Let’s demonstrate the always policy by starting a new interactive container with the --restart always flag and directing it to run a shell process. We’ll then type exit to terminate the shell process and the container to see what happens.

Run the following command to start an interactive container called neversaydie with the always restart policy.

$ docker run --name neversaydie -it --restart always alpine sh

Docker Containers: Key Commands

Get a brief summary of the commands for managing Docker containers covered in this chapter.
Summary of the Docker container commands

    docker run is the command to start new containers. We give it the name of an image, and it starts a container from it. For example, the docker run -it ubuntu bash command starts an interactive container from the Ubuntu image and runs the Bash shell.

    Ctrl-PQ is how we detach from a container stopping the process we’re attached to. We’ll use it frequently to detach from running containers without terminating them.

    docker ps lists all running containers, and we can add the -a flag to also see containers in the stopped (Exited) state.

    docker exec allows us to run commands inside containers. For example, the docker exec -it <container-name> bash command will start a new Bash shell inside a running container and connect your terminal to it. For this to work, the container must include the Bash shell. This command runs a ps command inside a running container without opening an interactive shell session: docker exec <container-name> ps.

    docker stop stops a running container and puts it in the Exited (137) state. It issues a SIGTERM to the container’s PID 1 process and allows the container 10 seconds to gracefully quit. If the process hasn’t cleaned up and stopped within 10 seconds, it sends a SIGKILL to force the container to immediately terminate.

    docker restart restarts a stopped container.

    docker rm deletes a stopped container. We can add the -f flag to delete the container without having to stop it first.

    docker inspect shows us the detailed configuration and runtime information about a container.

    docker debug attaches a debug shell to a container or image and lets us run commands that aren’t available inside the container or image. It requires a Pro, Team, or Business Docker subscription.
